WARNING:Place:1399 - A clock IOB / BUFGCTRL clock component pair have been found
   that are not placed at an optimal clock IOB / BUFGCTRL site pair. The clock
   IOB component <reset> is placed at site <M15>. The corresponding BUFGCTRL
   component <reset_IBUF_BUFG> is placed at site <BUFGCTRL_X0Y4>. The clock IO
   can use the fast path between the IOB and the Clock Buffer if the IOB is
   placed on a Clock Capable IOB site that has dedicated fast path to BUFGCTRL
   sites in its half of the device (TOP or BOTTOM). You may want to analyze why
   this problem exists and correct it. This is normally an ERROR but the
   CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint was applied on COMP.PIN <reset.PAD> allowing
   your design to continue. This constraint disables all clock placer rules
   related to the specified COMP.PIN. The use of this override is highly
   discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended
   that this error condition be corrected in the design.

WARNING:PhysDesignRules:2500 - This design does not have a PS7 block.
   Instantiate the PS7 block in order to ensure proper fabric tie-offs and
   correct operation of the processing_system7.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:372 - Gated clock. Clock net
   XLXI_6/reset_GND_6_o_OR_95_o is sourced by a combinatorial pin. This is not
   good design practice. Use the CE pin to control the loading of data into the
   flip-flop.

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
